# Awesome lists with GitHub and Quarto

### A project with the Open Life Science Cohort 7

**Making lists of resources is hard work, publishing them is even harder, and keeping them up to date with community input is near impossible.**

The project I have in mind for this program has 2 major components. The first component is to build a resource listing system, likely based on Quarto (https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings-custom.html), that will take data from YAML files, and convert to a listing on a static web page that allows for filter and sorting. The openlifesci.org website actually does an incredible job of displaying structured lists that come from YAML, but uses Jekyll to do this. I also intend to build out a system in GitHub actions that will accept and validate new entries that come through a form or GitHub Issues. The second component would be to create training program that teaches how to use the system â€“ while also teaching the concepts of version control, metadata schemas, and continuous integration to complete novices.
